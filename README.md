# template_matching in MATLAB
This project implements a basic template matching system using MATLAB. It is designed to identify and match bold, geometric sans-serif characters from an input snapshot against a set of pre-defined templates, and predict the characters along with their respective matching scores.

Note: The current implementation is optimized for bold, geometric sans-serif fonts and may not perform well on other font types.
